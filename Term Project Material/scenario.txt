Jonathan (22) wants to play a new video game that came out last week. But before buying it, he wants to know what does his
friends think about it. He opens the app and sign in via his e-mail address. Now he has different options in order to reach
the reviews of his friends about the game; the first option is to find the game in the main page and after selecting the game
he can reach the reviews made from his friends.
The second option is to search the name of the game from the search bar and reach again the reviews from there.
The third option is to search the name of a specific friend from his friend's list, and after selecting the profile of the 
friend, he can reach the review of that game (if the friend has reviewed it).
If he decide to buy the game after he read the reviews of his friends, he can add the game in his "wish list" where he can
keep track of the games that he wants to play, but didn't play yet.
After playing the game he can add it to his "game's list" in his profile and add a review about it, so that his friends can
read the review and decide if the game is worth it to play.
